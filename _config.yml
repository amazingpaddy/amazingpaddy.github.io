          **Client:** Ford, USA
          
          **Project Details**: Ford engineers use reports generated by an ETL framework to design future cars with low manufacturing costs. 
          We are migrating the ETL framework from Sqoop and Hive to Apache Spark Structured Streaming so that engineers can access near real-time reports.
          
          **Roles and Responsibilities**:
          - Migrated ETL framework from Sqoop/Hive to Apache Spark Structured Streaming for Ford Engineering.
          - Developed Spark Structured Streaming application using pyspark that reduced data processing time by 50% and increased report accuracy by 20%.
          - Implemented ETL pipelines using Apache Spark, Kafka and MongoDB that enabled engineers to utilize near real-time reports for designing future cars at low manufacturing cost.
          - Designed and developed Java application to efficiently fetch data from LDAP servers.
          - Refactored Java applications to improve readability and performance.
          - Explored new technologies using POCs and documented the approaches to implement new project requirements.
